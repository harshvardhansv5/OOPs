        "- Polymorphism is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows entities such as methods, variables, or objects to take on multiple forms. It enables a single interface to be used for different data types, making code more flexible, reusable, and easier to extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, polymorphism allows you to use the same method name in a parent class and override it in a child class to achieve behavior specific to the child class. It also allows methods to handle objects of different types in a uniform way (e.g., using method overriding or interfaces).\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main types of polymorphism in OOP:\n",
        "1. **Compile-time Polymorphism** (e.g., method overloading): Achieved during code compilation, where methods with the same name have different parameter types or counts.\n",
        "2. **Run-time Polymorphism** (e.g., method overriding): Achieved during program execution, where a child class overrides a method of its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Polymorphism is Important:\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: It allows the design of systems that can work with new or changing requirements without modifying existing code.\n",
        "- **Code Reusability**: Common behaviors can be implemented once in a base class and reused or customized in derived classes.\n",
        "- **Extensibility**: New classes can be added easily without breaking existing code.\n",
